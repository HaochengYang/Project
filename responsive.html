	<h1>FBI probes newly discovered emails tied to Clinton case</h1>
	<p>The emails in question were sent or received by Abedin, according to a law enforcement official. There were a "considerable number" of emails being reviewed from at least one device shared by Abedin and Weinder, the official said. A separate official described it as thousands of pages.</p>
	<p>The FBI is looking at whether any of the newly discovered emails will have an impact on the investigation into Clinton's server that was closed earlier this year.</p>
	<p>After recommending in July that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen Friday that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that "appear to be pertinent" to the email probe.</p>
